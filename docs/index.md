## Overview

**RMK** stands for "**R**educed **M**anagement for **K**ubernetes".
The main goal of the [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) tool is to simplify (**"reduce"**) the
management of Kubernetes clusters and releases,
serving as a "Swiss knife" for daily CI/CD and DevOps tasks while allowing efficient control
with a minimal set of CLI commands.

RMK serves as a wrapper for various popular CI/CD and DevOps CLI tools, including:

- [Helmfile](https://helmfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/)
- [clusterctl](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/clusterctl/overview)
- [K3D](https://k3d.io/)
- [SOPS](https://getsops.io/)
- [age](https://age-encryption.org/)

It leverages [Kubernetes Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) for cluster provisioning and management across
different environments, such as [cloud providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)
and [on-premise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software) deployments.

RMK has been designed to be used by different IT specialists, among them are DevOps engineers, software developers,
SREs,
cloud architects, system analytics, software testers and even managers with minimal technical background.

### Efficiency in numbers

Initially, it has been developed by [Edenlab LLC](https://edenlab.io/) as the main CLI for provisioning and managing
[Kodjin FHIR Server](https://kodjin.com) on Kubernetes clusters in different environments.

Since 2021, RMK has been an integral part of the companyâ€™s Kubernetes infrastructure, used regularly for automated
provisioning and destroy of temporary Kubernetes clusters for development and testing purposes, both manually and within
CI/CD pipelines.

**:rocket: Proven at scale**:

- **220+** clusters handled **monthly** (based on a 5-day workweek).
- **2,600+** clusters handled **annually**.
- **10,000+** clusters orchestrated **since 2021**.

Beyond internal use, RMK is also leveraged by various external clients to streamline their CI/CD workflows, ensuring
fast and
efficient Kubernetes environment management.

### Advantages

RMK simplifies the setup and management of Kubernetes-based projects of any complexity level due to the following
advantages:

- **Includes everything needed for daily CI/CD and DevOps tasks**:
  Utilizes [Kubernetes Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/)
  for provisioning clusters across various environments and providers,
  and [Helmfile](https://helmfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)/[Helm](https://helm.sh/)
  along with other tools for efficient release, secrets management across multiple clusters.
- **Integrates with any [CI/CD](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd) tool easily**: A self-sufficient,
  portable binary that strictly follows the [12 factor app](https://12factor.net/) methodology.
- **Supports [versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning) of projects in a CI/CD pipeline**: Each
  project can be versioned and referenced by static or dynamic tags (e.g., [SemVer2](https://semver.org/)),
  which guarantees stable, well-tested and predictable releases.
- **Provides a transparent project structure, generation from scratch, dependency management:** Enables rapid project
  setup, efficient configuration reuse across projects, inheritance from other projects, e.g., "parent-child" or "
  upstream-downstream" relationships.
- **Respects the [GitOps](https://www.gitops.tech/) approach:** Each Git branch is used as a unique identifier for
  determining the environment, cluster name,
  set of configurations and other attributes required for setting up the wrapped tools for project management in the
  Kubernetes environment.
- **Respects the [GitLab Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-gitlab-flow/) workflow**: Follows
  a standard branching model with _develop_, _staging_, _production_, and ephemeral branches (e.g., _feature_,
  _release_) for temporary environments.
- **Respects the [DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops) methodology:** Allows diverse teams to work without blocking
  each other. Each team or multiple teams can develop and release their projects separately, later on the result of
  their work can be combined in a single project.
- **Calls the CLI tools directly instead of using their libraries/SDKs**: RMK executes the tools directly in a way that
  a typical person would do it,
  passing correct sets of CLI arguments and flags to the commands based on a project configuration structure.
  This decouples the updating of RMK itself from the wrapped CLI tools, allowing developers to utilize recent
  functionality and fixes.

### Edenlab LLC use cases

At [Edenlab LLC](https://edenlab.io/), RMK is utilized to deploy the [Kodjin FHIR Server](https://kodjin.com)
across various cloud providers and on-premise environments.

Examples of Kubernetes providers where Kodjin has already been deployed include:

- [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
- [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/)
- [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
- [Open Telekom Cloud - Cloud Container Engine (CCE)](https://www.open-telekom-cloud.com/en/products-services/core-services/cloud-container-engine)
- [Rancher Kubernetes Platform](https://www.rancher.com/)
- [Kubermatic Kubernetes Platform (KKP)](https://www.kubermatic.com/)
- [On-premise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software) deployments
- Single-machine [K3D](https://k3d.io/) clusters

A standard Kodjin-based cluster follows a 4-level inheritance structure:

- **[cluster-deps](https://github.com/edenlabllc/cluster-deps.bootstrap.infra) (upstream#1)**:
  Provides [Kubernetes Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) and essential system components required by RMK
  for provisioning Kubernetes clusters across various providers.
- **Dependencies (upstream#2)**:
  Includes core components such as databases, search engines, caches, load balancers/proxies, and operators.
  etc., uses [cluster-deps](https://github.com/edenlabllc/cluster-deps.bootstrap.infra) as its primary project
  dependency.
- **[Kodjin](https://kodjin.com/) (downstream#1)**:
  A set of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) microservices that form the Kodjin FHIR
  API ([REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST)).
- **Target tenant (downstream#2)**:
  Encompasses products built on top of Kodjin, including UI components, user portals, and middleware services, such as
  the
  e.g., [Kodjin Demo FHIR Server](https://demo.kodjin.com/)

Each project ("tenant") follows a
standard [GitLab Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-gitlab-flow/) branching model.

  - **Linux**: amd64
- **Software:**
  - **Python** >= 3.9
  - _For managing local clusters using K3D:_ Version _v5.x.x_ requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) => v20.10.5 ([runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) >= v1.0.0-rc93) to work
        properly.

> If this is your first project repository managed by RMK, ensure that the above tools are specified in the [project.yaml](configuration/project-management/preparation-of-project-repository.md#projectyaml) file.

## Installation

To install RMK, run the self-installer script using the following command:

```shell
curl -sL "https://edenlabllc-rmk.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/rmk/s3-installer" | bash
```

Alternatively, you can go directly to https://github.com/edenlabllc/rmk/releases and download the binary.

As another option, the binary can be [built from source](development-and-release.md#building-from-source).

## Update

### General update process

To update RMK to the latest version, run the following command:

```shell
rmk update
```

### Update to specific version

You can update to a specific RMK version to maintain backward compatibility or when updating to the latest version is not possible. 

> This may be necessary due to specific version requirements or when a bug has been detected. 

To update to a specific version, use the following command:

```shell
rmk update --version vX.X.X 
```
