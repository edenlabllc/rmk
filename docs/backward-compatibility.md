# Backward compatibility

## Breaking change releases

**[v0.44.2](https://github.com/edenlabllc/rmk/releases/tag/v0.44.2) -> [v0.45.0](https://github.com/edenlabllc/rmk/releases/tag/v0.45.0)**

### Motivations

Migrating RMK `v0.45.0` from **Terraform** to **Cluster API**

We are replaced the technology stack for provisioning clusters in RMK `v0.45.0`, transitioning from Terraform to [Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/). 
This shift was driven by several key factors:

Why We Switched to Cluster API?

1. Maintaining Open-Source Integrity:
   Terraform's transition to a BSL license conflicts with our commitment to keeping RMK fully open-source (OSS). 
   By switching to Cluster API, we ensure that our customers' interests remain unaffected.
   More details on the [Terraform license change](https://www.hashicorp.com/license-faq).

2. A more native Kubernetes Solution:
   We needed a provisioning approach that seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes across various environments. 
   With the new RMK `v0.45.0`, we now support:

   - AWS
   - Azure
   - GCP
   - On-Premise (support is expected in upcoming releases)
   - K3D (local installation)
   
3. Simplified Configuration Management:
   Cluster configurations are now stored in Helm charts, aligning with the way installed components are managed. 
   This ensures a unified format for all declarations.

4. Seamless Cluster Upgrades:
   Our new approach makes cluster updates easier and Kubernetes-native, leveraging:

   - Pod status awareness
   - Zero downtime upgrades

> This transition marks a significant step in enhancing RMKâ€™s provisioning capabilities, ensuring better scalability, 
> openness, and ease of management. Stay tuned for more updates in upcoming releases! ðŸš€

### How to migrate to RMK v0.45.0 version from currently

#### For newly created project repositories

Before performing actions via RMK with this project repository, simply update to `v0.45.0` version.

```shell
rmk update
```

#### For previously created project repositories for the AWS cluster provider

> For correct migration, be sure to follow the steps in strict order.

1. Download private Age keys in the current RMK version if you haven't done it earlier.

   ```shell
   rmk config init --github-token=<GitHub_PAT>
   ```

   > Skip this step if you lack administrator permissions for the selected `AWS` account.

2. Save the path to the private Age keys storage directory to an environment variable.

   ```shell
   export RMK_OLD_PATH_AGE_KEYS="$(rmk --log-format=json config view | yq '.config.SopsAgeKeys')"
   ```

   > Skip this step if you lack administrator permissions for the selected `AWS` account.

3. Update your current version to `v0.45.0`.

   ```shell
   rmk update
   ```

4. Add root domain specification in [project.yaml](configuration/project-management/preparation-of-project-repository.md#projectyaml) 
   for project repository.

   ```yaml
   project:
     # ...
     spec:
       environments:
         develop:
           root-domain: <custom_root_domain_name> # or <*.edenlab.dev> if you member Edenlab team
         production:
           root-domain: <custom_root_domain_name> # or <*.edenlab.dev> if you member Edenlab team
         staging:
           root-domain: <custom_root_domain_name> # or <*.edenlab.dev> if you member Edenlab team
   ```
   
   > If the [project.yaml](configuration/project-management/preparation-of-project-repository.md#projectyaml) file 
   > already had a `spec.environments` section, be sure to replace it with a `spec.environments` with a root domain. 
   
   ```yaml
   project:
     # ...
     spec:
       environments:
         - develop # deprecated
         - production # deprecated
         - staging # deprecated
   ```

   > Skip this step if the [project.yaml](configuration/project-management/preparation-of-project-repository.md#projectyaml) 
   > file was previously modified to match the new specification.

5. [Initialize](configuration/configuration-management/init-aws-provider.md#configuration-of-aws) a new configuration 
   specifying the `AWS` cluster provider. 

   ```shell
   rmk config init --cluster-provider=aws \
       --aws-access-key-id=<aws_access_key_id> \
       --aws-region=<aws_region> \
       --aws-secret-access-key=<aws_secret_access_key> \
       --github-token=<GitHub_PAT>
   ```

6. Copy from old path private `Age keys` in new directory.

   ```shell
   cp -f "${RMK_OLD_PATH_AGE_KEYS}"/* $(rmk --log-format=json config view | yq '.config.SopsAgeKeys')
   unset RMK_OLD_PATH_AGE_KEYS
   ```

   > Skip this step if you lack administrator permissions for the selected `AWS` account.

7. Upload old private Age keys to `AWS Secret Manager`.

   ```shell
   rmk secret keys upload
   ```
   
   > Skip this step if you lack administrator permissions for the selected `AWS` account.
