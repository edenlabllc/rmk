# Backward compatibility

## Breaking change releases

---

### [v0.44.2](https://github.com/edenlabllc/rmk/releases/tag/v0.44.2) -> [v0.45.0](https://github.com/edenlabllc/rmk/releases/tag/v0.45.0)

### Motivation

The main change in the [v0.45.0](https://github.com/edenlabllc/rmk/releases/tag/v0.45.0) RMK version is the
**replacement** of the technology stack for **cluster provisioning**, transitioning
from [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to [Kubernetes Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/).

This change was driven by several **key factors**:

1. **Maintaining open-source integrity**:

   Terraform's transition to a BSL license **conflicts** with our commitment to keeping RMK **fully open-source (OSS)**.
   By switching to Kubernetes Cluster API, we ensure that our customers' interests remain **unaffected**.

   More details on the Terraform's license change are available at the [link](https://www.hashicorp.com/license-faq).

2. **Kubernetes-native solution**:

   We needed a provisioning approach that **seamlessly integrates** with Kubernetes across various environments.

   With the new `v0.45.0` version, we now support
   [AWS](configuration/configuration-management/init-aws-provider.md),
   [Azure](configuration/configuration-management/init-azure-provider.md),
   [GCP](configuration/configuration-management/init-gcp-provider.md),
   [K3D](configuration/configuration-management/init-k3d-provider.md) (local installation).

   > **On-premise** support expected in **upcoming releases**.

3. **Simplified configuration management**:

   Cluster configurations are now stored in [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/), aligning with the way
   installed components are managed. This ensures a **unified format** for all declarations.

4. **Seamless cluster upgrades**:

   Our new approach makes cluster updates **Kubernetes-native** with
   [pod status awareness](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) and
   [zero-downtime upgrades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtime#Service_levels).

> This transition marks a **significant step** in enhancing RMKâ€™s provisioning capabilities, ensuring better
> scalability, openness, and ease of management. [Stay tuned](index.md#roadmap) for more updates in upcoming releases!

### Steps to migrate

#### Newly created project repositories

Before performing actions via RMK with this project repository, **simply update** to `v0.45.0` version.

```shell
rmk update
```

#### Previously created project repositories for the AWS cluster provider

> To ensure a successful migration, strictly follow the steps in the **specified order**.

1. Download private [SOPS Age keys](configuration/secrets-management/secrets-management.md#secret-keys) of the current
   RMK version if you haven't done it earlier.

   ```shell
   rmk config init --github-token=<github_personal_access_token>
   ```

   > Skip this step if you lack **administrator permissions** for the selected AWS account.

2. Save the path to the private SOPS Age keys storage directory to an environment variable.

   ```shell
   export RMK_SOPS_AGE_KEYS_PATH_OLD="$(rmk --log-format=json config view | yq '.config.SopsAgeKeys')"
   ```

   > Skip this step if you lack **administrator permissions** for the selected AWS account.

3. Update your current version to `v0.45.0`.

   ```shell
   rmk update
   ```

4. Add root domain specification
   in [project.yaml](configuration/project-management/preparation-of-project-repository.md#projectyaml) for project
   repository.

   ```yaml
   project:
     # ...
     spec:
       environments:
         develop:
           root-domain: <custom_root_domain_name> # or <*.edenlab.dev> for the Edenlab team
         production:
           root-domain: <custom_root_domain_name> # or <*.edenlab.dev> for the Edenlab team
         staging:
           root-domain: <custom_root_domain_name> # or <*.edenlab.dev> for the Edenlab team
   ```

   If the [project.yaml](configuration/project-management/preparation-of-project-repository.md#projectyaml) file has
   the `spec.environments` section already:

   ```yaml
   project:
     # ...
     spec:
       environments:
         - develop # removed
         - production # removed
         - staging # removed
   ```

   be sure to replace it with `spec.environments` with the root domains.

5. [Initialize](configuration/configuration-management/init-aws-provider.md#configuration-of-aws) a new configuration
   specifying the AWS cluster provider.

   ```shell
   rmk config init --cluster-provider=aws \
       --aws-access-key-id=<aws_access_key_id> \
       --aws-region=<aws_region> \
       --aws-secret-access-key=<aws_secret_access_key> \
       --github-token=<github_personal_access_token>
   ```

6. Copy private SOPS Age keys from the old path
   to the new directory.

   ```shell
   cp -f "${RMK_SOPS_AGE_KEYS_PATH_OLD}"/* $(rmk --log-format=json config view | yq '.config.SopsAgeKeys')
   unset RMK_SOPS_AGE_KEYS_PATH_OLD
   ```

   > Skip this step if you lack **administrator permissions** for the selected AWS account.

7. Upload the old private SOPS Age keys to [AWS Secret Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/).

   ```shell
   rmk secret keys upload
   ```

   > Skip this step if you lack **administrator permissions** for the selected AWS account.
