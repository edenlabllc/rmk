# Exported environment variables

By default, RMK exports the following environment variables to each execution of commands within the 
[rmk release](../../commands.md#release) category:

```shell
# Tenant name, which is equivalent to the project name.
# For example:
# TENANT=rmk-test
TENANT="<project_name>"

# RMK configuration name for the current project (tenant) and environment.
# For example:
# NAME=rmk-test-develop
NAME="<project_name>-<project_branch>"

# Category of the executed RMK command (e.g., cluster, capi, k3d, release, secret, etc).
# Used to enable conditional logic in various cases, such as toggling Helmfile releases.
# For example:
# RMK_COMMAND_CATEGORY=k3d
RMK_COMMAND_CATEGORY="<command_category>"

# Root domain name for target applications in the cluster.
# For example:
# ROOT_DOMAIN=rmk-test-develop.edenlab.dev
ROOT_DOMAIN="<project_name>-<project_branch>.<domain>"

# Path to the file containing the merged private SOPS Age keys.
# For example:
# SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=/home/user/.rmk/sops-age-keys/rmk-test/.keys.txt
SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE="${HOME}/.rmk/sops-age-keys/<project_name>/.keys.txt"

# GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT). 
# https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens
# For example:
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
GITHUB_TOKEN="<github_personal_access_token>"

# Path to the directory containing the specific version of hooks required by the downstream (current) project.
# For example:
# HELMFILE_RMK_TEST_HOOKS_DIR=/home/user/rmk-test/.PROJECT/inventory/hooks/helmfile.hooks.infra-v1.29.1
HELMFILE_<project_name>_HOOKS_DIR="${PWD}/.PROJECT/inventory/hooks/<project_hooks_repo_name>-<project_hooks_version>"

# Paths to the directories of the inherited upstream projects required by the downstream (current) project (in JSON format).
# For example:
# HELMFILE_RMK_TEST_PATHS=[{"path":"/home/user/rmk-test/.PROJECT/dependencies/rmk-test.bootstrap.infra-v0.1.0/helmfile.yaml.gotmpl"}]
HELMFILE_<project_name>_PATHS='[{"path":"${PWD}/.PROJECT/dependencies/<upstream_project_name>-<upstream_project_version>/helmfile.yaml.gotmpl"}]'

# Path to the directory containing the specific version of hooks required by the inherited upstream project.
# For example:
# HELMFILE_CLUSTER_DEPS_HOOKS_DIR=/home/user/rmk-test/.PROJECT/inventory/hooks/helmfile.hooks.infra-v1.29.1
HELMFILE_<upstream_project_name>_HOOKS_DIR="${PWD}/.PROJECT/inventory/hooks/<upstream_project_hooks_repo_name>-<upstream_project_hooks_version>"

# Version of the inherited upstream project.
# For example:
# HELMFILE_CLUSTER_DEPS_BOOTSTRAP_INFRA_VERSION=v0.1.0
HELMFILE_<upstream_project_name>_VERSION="<upstream_project_version>"

# Flag indicating whether the cluster is K3D (Kubernetes Cluster API management cluster).
# The variable can be used to override values in the releases.
CAPI_CLUSTER=false
# The flag that indicates whether the cluster is K3D (local cluster). 
# The variable can be used to override values in the releases.
K3D_CLUSTER=false
# The K3D cluster name equaling exported environment variable $NAME.
K3D_NAME="${NAME}"
# The local directory path for mount into K3D cluster.
# By default, the RMK startup path is used.
K3D_VOLUME_HOST_PATH="${PWD}"

# Only for Kubernetes Cluster API Provider AWS: 
# AWS cluster provider configuration
# Note: An AWS access key must be created in advance:
#       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html
#       AWS config and credentials files will be automatically generated by RMK during the configuration initialization
# For example:
# AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=123456789012
# AWS_REGION=us-east-1
# AWS_PROFILE=rmk-test-develop
# AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/home/user/.aws/config_rmk-test-develop

AWS_ACCOUNT_ID="<aws_account_id>"
AWS_CLUSTER=true
AWS_REGION="<aws_region>"
AWS_PROFILE="<project_name>-<project_branch>"
AWS_CONFIG_FILE="${HOME}/.aws/config_<project_name>-<project_branch>"
AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE="${HOME}/.aws/credentials_<project_name>-<project_branch>"

# Only for Kubernetes Cluster API Provider Azure:
# Azure cluster provider configuration
# Note: Azure service principal must be created in advance:
#       https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals
# For example:
# AZURE_LOCATION=eastus
# AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=abcdef12-3456-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
AZURE_CLUSTER=true
AZURE_LOCATION="<azure_location>"
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<azure_subscription_id>"

# Only for Kubernetes Cluster API Provider GCP:

# Note: Google Cloud application credentials must be created in advance: 
#       https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials 
# For example:
