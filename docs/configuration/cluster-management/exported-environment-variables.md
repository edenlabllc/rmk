# Exported environment variables

By default, RMK exports the following environment variables to each launch of the `rmk release` category's commands:

[//]: # (  TODO ACTUALIZE)

```shell
# AWS credentials are automatically generated by RMK during the configuration initialization
AWS_PROFILE=<project_name>-<project_branch>
AWS_CONFIG_FILE=${HOME}/.aws/config_<project_name>-<project_branch>
AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=${HOME}/.aws/credentials_<project_name>-<project_branch>
# For example:
# AWS_PROFILE=rmk-test-develop
# AWS_CONFIG_FILE=${HOME}/.aws/config_rmk-test-develop
# AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=${HOME}/.aws/credentials_rmk-test-develop

# GitHub Personal Access Token
GITHUB_TOKEN=<github_personal_access_token>

# The path to the directory of the specific version of hooks required for the inherited upstream project
HELMFILE_<upstream_project_name>_HOOKS_DIR=${PWD}/.PROJECT/inventory/hooks/<hooks_repo_name>-<version>
# For example:
# HELMFILE_DEPS_HOOKS_DIR=${PWD}/.PROJECT/inventory/hooks/helmfile.hooks.infra-v1.18.0

# The path to the directory of the specific version of hooks required for the downstream project
HELMFILE_<downstream_project_name>_HOOKS_DIR=${PWD}/.PROJECT/inventory/hooks/<hooks_repo_name>-<version>
# For example:
# HELMFILE_RMK_TEST_HOOKS_DIR=${PWD}/.PROJECT/inventory/hooks/helmfile.hooks.infra-v1.18.0

# The paths to the directories of the listed inherited upstream projects in the JSON format.
HELMFILE_<project_name>_PATHS='[{"path":"${PWD}/.PROJECT/dependencies/<upstream_repo_name>-<upstream_repo_version>/helmfile.yaml.gotmpl"}]'
# For example:
# HELMFILE_RMK_TEST_PATHS=[{"path":"${PWD}/.PROJECT/dependencies/deps.bootstrap.infra-v2.18.0/helmfile.yaml.gotmpl"}]

# The version of the inherited upstream project
HELMFILE_<project_repo_name>_VERSION=vN.N.N
# For example:
# HELMFILE_DEPS_BOOTSTRAP_INFRA_VERSION=v2.18.0

# The configuration RMK name for the current project and environment
NAME=<project_name>-<project_branch>
# For example:
# NAME=rmk-test-develop

# The root domain name for target applications in the cluster
ROOT_DOMAIN=<project_name>-<project_branch>.example.com
# For example:
# ROOT_DOMAIN=rmk-test-develop.example.com

# The path to the file with the merged private Age keys
SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=${HOME}/.rmk/sops-age-keys/<project_name>-sops-age-keys-<short_AWS_account_id>/.keys.txt
# For example:
# SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=${HOME}/.rmk/sops-age-keys/rmk-test-sops-age-keys-28804/.keys.txt

# The tenant name, which is an equivalent to the project name
TENANT=<project_name>
# For example:
# NAME=rmk-test

# The flag that indicates whether the cluster is currently based on K3D. The variable can be used for overriding values in the releases.
K3D_CLUSTER=true
```

> All exported variables and their values of the `rmk release command` category can be viewed by running all these commands in the debug mode:
> ```shell
> rmk --log-level=debug release list
> ```
